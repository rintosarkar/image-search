# Tailwind CSS Initial project for plain HTML

A simple starter project for playing around with Tailwind in a proper PostCSS environment with HTML.

To get started:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
 git clone https://hemaet@bitbucket.org/hemaet/tailwind-init.git

 cd tailwind-init
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
# Using npm
npm install

#Using Yarn
yarn
```

3. Start the development server:

Now you should be able to see the project running at localhost:8080.

4. Open `public/index.html` in your editor and start experimenting!

## Building for production

Even though this isn't necessarily a starter kit for a proper project, we've included an example of setting up [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/) to optimize your CSS for production.

To build an optimized version of your CSS, simply run:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run production

# Using Yarn
yarn production
```

After that's done, check out `./public/build/tailwind.css` to see the optimized output.
